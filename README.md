# Module 20 Challenge - React Portfolio

This application is a React version of the portfolio submitted for Challenge 2 early in our program.  It includes contact information, a basic bio about me, and a few example projects that I have completed over the course of this program.

This application is made with HTML, CSS, JSX and React.

A link to the application can be found here:  https://catherinecunningham.github.io/react-portfolio/
